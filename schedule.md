# Session 2  - Programming with Python

## Program

12:15 - Organizers/instructors/helpers in the Zoom meeting room to check last set ups, introductions etc
12:30 - Start workshop and let participants in! We should not need time to check installations as any remaining problems are addressed on day 3. 

12:30 - Welcome and instructions of the day @ Paula
- Reminder Code of Conduct/How to get help. 
- Programme of the day
- Ice breaker

12:40 - Recap of Day 2 (5 minutes)
12:45 - Making Choices (20 minutes teaching + 5 minutes exercise)
- [Lesson 7](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/07-cond/index.html)

**Plenary Exercises:**
- Plenum: [How many paths?](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/07-cond/index.html#how-many-paths )

- Together, inspect all datasets for suspicious data

13:15 - Creating Functions (20 minutes teaching + 5 minutes plenum exercises)
- [Lesson 8](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/08-func/index.html)
  _Skipping: Testing and Documentation_

**Plenary Exercises:**
- Plenum: [Mixing Default and Non-Default Parameters](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/08-func/index.html#mixing-default-and-non-default-parameters )


13:35 - Breakout Session 1 (25 min) 
[Exercise 7](python_excercises_2.slides.html) (open in browser)

These exercises can also be found on the SWC website:

- ["Rescaling an Array"](https://scw-ss.github.io/2021-03-16-tudelft-online-python-novice-inflammation/08-func/index.html#rescaling-an-array )
- ["Testing and Documenting Your Function"](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/08-func/index.html#testing-and-documenting-your-function )

- Optional: [Refine the rescale function via "Defining Defaults"](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/08-func/index.html#defining-defaults-1)


14:00: Coffee Break I

**ADDED part on modular code**
1.	[Tidying-up](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/08-func/index.html#tidying-up)
2.	Create script called `processing.py`
3.	Copy functions (visualize, detect_problems) to script
4.	Create new notebook called `inflammation_analysis_refactored.ipynb`
5.	Import (visualize, detect_problems) in the new notebook and place in for-loop to analyse for all files
6.	Questions in session:
a.	Do we still need to import numpy and matplotlib when we are importing them in the `processing.py` script? 
_No, this is handled in the script._
b.	What happens to the savefig in the loop? 
_Currently, during each loop the file `imflammation.png` is overwritten. Solution for future sessions: We could add new savenames or leave the savefig out of the functions entirely for simplicity._

14:15: Errors and Exceptions (15 minutes teaching + 5 minutes exercise)
- [Lesson 9](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/09-errors/index.html)

Example plenum:
- **SKIPPED:** [Reading Error Messages](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/09-errors/index.html#reading-error-messages )

14:40: Defensive Programming (20 min)
- [Lesson 10](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/10-defensive/index.html)
- Example for a pre-condition to find empty array
- Add precondition to inflammation_analysis.ipynb
- **Skipped:** Replace previous conditional statements in `inflammation_analysis.ipynb` by assertions

Questions during session:
a. _When would you use assert and when a conditional statement?_
Assert is used to verify the correct usage and executation of your code. Conditional statements are used to handle choices as part of the code functionality.

15:05: **SKIPPED DUE TO LACK OF TIME!**
